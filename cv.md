## Summary

I make it my goal to strengthen my position as a web-developer. It's important for me to have opportunity of professional growth in the web-development sphere. I would be happy to work with friendly, responsive and experienced teammates on projects.

I'm ready to spend a lot of time to what I like - development. I can motivate and discipline myself. I'm capable of finding common grounds with people, with teammates. I always support criticism to my address according to my technical skills and go forward to liquidate every drawback.

I'm a graduate student of [BSUIR](https://www.bsuir.by/). I have fundamental knowledge and skills with some experience in technologies that I'm going to mention later in Skills section. But this all will not prevent me to learn **new**, to learn **a lot** and **develop** myself as a web-developer.

I'm ready to do my best to grow up as a strong and skillful specialist and to promote company's interests.
