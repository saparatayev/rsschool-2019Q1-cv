##Summary

I make it my goal to start junior front-end developer's career. It's important to have opportunity of professional growth in the front-end sphere. I would be happy to work with friendly, responsive and experienced teammates on projects.

I'm ready to spend a lot of time to what I like - development. I can motivate and discipline myself. I'm capable of finding common grounds with people, with teammates. I always support criticism to my address according to my technical skills and go forward to liquidate every drawback.

I'm a last-year student of BSUIR. I have fundamental knowledge and skills with minimum experience in technologies that I'm giong to mention later in "Skills" section. But lack of experience will not prevent me to learn **new** and to learn **a lot.**

I'm ready to do my best to grow up as a strong and skillful specialist and to promote company's interests.
